Authorization of Electronic Fund Transfer Using Information from 3 Check

When you provide a check as a payment, you authorize us either to use the information from your check to make a one-time
electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your
check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day you make your
payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. For more information or to stop the electronic
fund transfer, please call our Customer Service Department at 877-219-9550.

In Case of Errors or Questions about Your Electronic Fund Transfer

If you think your bank account statement or receipt is wrong or you need more information about a transfer on the statement or
receipt, please contact our Customer Service Department at 877-219-9550 as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later
than 60 days after you receive the first statement on which the error or problem appeared. Please provide the following information
when contacting our Customer Service Department:

1) Name and account number

2) A description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as possible why you believe it is
an error or why you need more information

3) Dollar amount of the suspected error.

We will investigate your complaint and will correct your error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days to do this, we will
credit your account for the amount you think is in error so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to
complete our investigation.
